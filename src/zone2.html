                    <p>
                        If you are looking to keep yourself a little bit more secure than zone 1, this zone/method is
                        for you! Here you will find more complex ways to keep your information safe from the rest of
                        the internet.

                    <b>Communication</b>

                    Texting is one unsafe way of communicating because it is not always secure, alternatives like
                    Facebook Messenger or Instagram DM's are not good at
                    keeping your data secure either. If you have aan apple device, stick to only using imessage, or use
                    Signal(app) the most secure messenger. Signal is an open source and
                    everything is fully encrypted where only you and the person youâ€™re texting can view your messages.
                    If you are an Android user, it can be set
                    up as your default SMS.

                    <b>Your Smartphone</b>
                    <p>
                        The ongoing debate on which is better, Iphone or Android can be established today! Iphone is the
                        most secure device while
                        Android devices are more likely to get infiltrated because they do not get regular security
                        updates. However, if you have
                        a stock Android device it does get frequent updates and it is a much better option.

                    </p>
                    <b>Storage</b>
                    <p>
                        You need to periodically wipe your hard drives to free up space and you can do so by using a
                        tool
                        like CCleaner so you cannot recover any of the files you decide to delete. Another key element
                        in storage is encryption, you should be using drive encryption and you should never remove the
                        encryption from any device, especially android, if you are given the option to do so.
                    </p>

                    <b>Your Web Browser</b>
                    <p>
                      You should avoid web browsers like chrome because Google has been known to collect your data. Web
                        browsers like firefox or any other privacy based browser to keep your privacy secure. In terms
                        of extension you should use an ad blocker such as uBlock Origin, a tracker blocker such as
                        Privacy Badger, and HTTPS Everywhere to keep you using HTTPS instead of HTTP. Ensure flash and
                        JavaScript are also disabled in your browser.
