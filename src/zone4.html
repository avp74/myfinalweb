                        This is the ultimate method to achieving a full private life where there isn't a single
                        trace of your identity on the web. You will most likely not have a smartphone but rather a flip
                        phone, and you will never be tracked.

                    <b>Erase Your Identity</b>
                    <p>
                        Goal: Remove links between your accounts, the internet, and yourself in real life.
                    <li>Fill your emails with mail bombers, to flood your cache and all your sensitive information will
                        be overwritten.
                    </li>
                    <li>Upload pictures of other people to make it hard to determine who the account belongs to, then
                        change the information on your accounts.
                    </li>
                    <li>Delete your accounts and services you signed up for.</li>

                        If someone wants to find more about you and they may ask your friends to get more information
                        about you.
                    <li>Don't talk to strangers</li>
                    <li>Never give any of your personal information (create a different identity)</li>
                    <li>Change your speech patterns</li>

                    <p>
                        NO PHONE, or a flip phone that does not allow SMS! This will ensure your private conversations are
                        not being invaded!
