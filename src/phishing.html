                    <div class="card-body">
                        Phishing is similar to fishing in the aspect that one is using bait, yet different because the
                        bait is not used to
                        catch fish, but rather humans who fall for fake emails or websites created by cybercriminals to
                        obtain personal
                        information. These emails or websites often look too good to be true in the way that they offer
                        a big prize if the
                        user clicks on their hyperlink. The emails also pose a sense of urgency in the way that they may
                        portray the email
                        as an urgent matter in need of the user to perhaps ‘update’ their personal information in order
                        to not face a
                        consequence or suspension of their account.

                    <div class="card-body">
                        Just this year in January, the Puerto Rican government had accidentally allowed phishers to
                        obtain 2.6 million
                        dollars due to an email phishing scam. The email claimed that the government agency’s existing
                        bank account could no
                        longer be used, thus the money had to be transferred to a new bank account. The email detailed
                        the new account to be
                        used, which turned out to be fraudulent and under the cybercriminals control.
