                    <b>Passwords</b>
                    <p>
                        At this point you should have a complex password to have access to your operating
                        system. These passwords will protect your bios and storage drives so no one can have access to
                        your operating
                        system without having to type out the password.

                    <b>Ditching Google & Your Social Media</b>
                    <p>
                        One of the largest data collectors. It is convenient because it has everything in one location
                        which makes it difficult to stop using. You will have to delete everything including your google
                        account. You will also have to get rid of all your social media because it puts your privacy in
                        danger.

                    </p>
                    <b>Using a New Web Browser</b>
                    <p>
                        Switching over to a web broswer like "Tor Browser", will encrypt your traffic and mask your IP
                        address. You will have to get rid of any other browser you are using. To connect your android
                        devices to your
                        tor browser you can download apps such as "Orbot" and "Orfox" to connect to your network and
                        browser.
