                        If you are looking to keep yourself secure and organized, this zone/method is for you! The other
                        zones may even require you to delete yourself from online services and you may not be ready for
                        that yet. In this zone, you will find basic ways to keep your information safe from the rest of
                        the internet.

                    </p>
                    <b>Passwords</b>

                    <li>Find yourself a good a password manager with all of your passwords
                        inside of it with a strong secure password.</li>
                    <li>You should also never answer your security questions truthfully, because anyone can look up
                        where you were born or who your parents are, all from searching you up and identifying key
                        information.</li>
                    <li>Don't overlook your computer and smartphone passwords because those can be easily broken into.
                        For your passwords you should always use text, numbers and symbols.</li>

                        </p>
                        <b>Your Web Browser</b>
                        <p>
                            You can use any web browser you desire, but be sure that the add-ons and extensions are
                            trusted.
                            You can switch your search engine to either "DuckDuckGo" or "Startpage" which are very
                            trustworthy.
                            You should also never store cookies, your history, or cache, but if you do, clear them
                            yourself frequently.
                        </p>

                        <b>VPNS</b>
                        <p>Hide your identity on the websites you visit, your internet service provider, or anyone
                            trying to
                            track you. VPN’s are encrypted therefore nobody can see what you’re doing. Stay away from
                            free
                            VPNs, and avoid proxies. They are so important to keep yourself protected and you need to
                            have one.
                        </p>
                        <b>Social Media</b>

                        <p>
                            Hide your real information (names, phone numbers, addresses, etc) and do not talk to
                            strangers,only
                            your close friends. Do not post in public comments and disable permissions.. These services
                            do not
                            need to access your location and apps like Snapchat does not need to access your SMS.
                            Do not post any pictures of yourself because you will be easy to target in person.
